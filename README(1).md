# Smart Contracts and It's real word use cases

A "**Smart Contract**" is simply a program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It's a collection of code (its functions) and data that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain. It's a type of Ethereum account. This means they have a balance and can be the target of transactions. However they're not controlled by a user, instead they are deployed to the network and run as programmed. User accounts can then interact with a smart contract by submitting transactions that execute a function defined on the smart contract. Smart contracts can define rules, like a regular contract, and automatically enforce them via the code. Smart contracts cannot be deleted by default, and interactions with them are irreversible.

Smart contacts can revolutionise how we conduct business and interact with each other.These self-executing digital contracts can be used for any business where data is involved which help eliminate the need for intermediaries and increase transaction efficiency and transparency. From finance to supply chain management, smart contracts can transform various industries.

## **Real Estate:** 
Using smart contracts in the real estate industry can enable buyers and sellers to create a secure and transparent agreement that executes automatically upon fulfilling predetermined conditions. This process automation can reduce the time and costs associated with traditional buying and selling real estate methods and eliminate the need for intermediaries like lawyers. 
For example, a smart contract could be used to automate the title transfer process in real estate. The buyer and seller can create a contract specifying the agreement's terms, including the purchase price and any contingencies that must be met. Once the conditions are met, such as the purchase price payment and ownership transfer, the contract is automatically executed, and the title is transferred to the buyer.

## **Insurance:** 
Implementing smart contracts can revolutionise the insurance industry by automating the claims process and making it more efficient. Smart contracts can eliminate manual intervention, streamlining the entire process from claim verification to payment execution.
For instance, consider a scenario where a policyholder has a travel insurance policy that covers flight cancellations. If their flight gets canceled, they can submit a claim to the insurer through a smart contract. The smart contract can automatically verify the claim by checking the flight status and determining the policyholder's eligibility for a payout. Once the claim is approved, the smart contract can automatically execute the payment to the policyholder's account. This process reduces the time and effort needed by the policyholder and the insurer to settle the claim, resulting in a faster and more efficient experience for all parties involved.

## **Supply Chain Management:** 
Smart contracts can create a transparent and secure supply chain. They can track the movement of goods, verify the authenticity of products, and ensure compliance with regulations. With smart contracts, all parties in the supply chain can access the same information, increasing transparency and reducing the risk of fraud.
For example, a company that produces organic products can use smart contracts to ensure the entire supply chain is transparent, from the farm to the supermarket shelf. The smart contract could track the movement of the goods, verify the authenticity of the products, and ensure compliance with regulations such as organic certification. The transparency offered by smart contracts increases consumer confidence in the product, as they have access to the entire history of the product, from the origin to the end consumer.

## **Voting:**
Smart contracts offer automation and enhanced security to the voting process. These contracts can increase the state of accurate vote counts, decrease the possibility of voter fraud, and enhance transparency in the election process. Moreover, smart contracts can make it more convenient for people to participate in elections .
For instance, imagine a country with many remote areas where people face difficulty accessing polling stations. With smart contracts, voters can use their digital devices to cast their ballots through a decentralized platform from the comfort of their homes. Smart contracts can ensure the authenticity and accuracy of each vote, and the votes are counted without any manual intervention. 

## **Healthcare:**
Smart contracts have the potential to revolutionise the healthcare industry by offering increased efficiency and security in transactions. One of the key benefits of smart contracts in healthcare is the ability to automate the medical claims process, which can lead to reduced administrative costs and faster claim processing times. 
For instance, a smart contract could be used to keep track of a patient's medical history, including their past treatments, medications, and allergies. This would enable healthcare providers to access patients' medical records easily, regardless of their location or the healthcare facility they visit.
