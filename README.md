# blockchain-learning-week-2

This repository contains assignments for Week 2 of the Blockchain Learning curriculum, focusing on Advance Javascript, Understanding solidity, smartcontracts, DOAs, usage of hybrid smart contracts, hardhat OpenZepplin libraries and deploying ERC20 token using hardhat.


## Exercises:

**Exercise 8: Asynchronous Data Fetch**
   -- Use JavaScript's Fetch API to retrieve data from the **[JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)**.
- Handle potential errors using both Promises (**`.then`** & **`.catch`**) and Async/Await.
   - File: `exercise8.js`

 **Exercise 9: Data Manipulation**
    - After fetching data in Exercise 8, filter out and log posts written by a specific user.
    - Implement this both with and without Async/Await.
   - File: `exercise9.js`
  
**Exercise 10: Basic Smart Contract**
- Write a smart contract named **`SimpleStorage`** that stores a number and allows functions to get and set that number.
- Deploy the contract using the Remix Ethereum IDE.
   - File: `exercise3.js`

**Exercise 10: Token Contract**
- Write a basic ERC-20 token smart contract with functions to mint, burn, transfer, and check balance.
- Understand the importance of safety checks and validations in the contract.
- Deploy the contract using hardhat.
   - File: `exercise4.js`

**Exercise 12: Reflection**
Write a brief summary (~300 words) of the potential applications of smart contracts you envision in industries like finance, healthcare, or real estate.

## Test the Code:
To tests the code, you can run it in the Visual Studio Code debugger terminal and Remix IDE. Exercise 11 would require, hardhat Open Zepplin libraries and node.js extensions to be installed for Visual Studio Debugger. You can take reference from this video to install the extensions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KGvY9-g1_w
